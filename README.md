This research will examine how the Decision Tree Algorithm and K-Nearest algorithm perform when applied to a dataset containing readings from the fetus's CTG during labor and later phases of pregnancy. The fetal health dataset was obtained from the Kaggle website, and the algorithms were run on the Google Collab platform. Decision Tree and KNN algorithms are supervised learning algorithms applicable for tasks that involve either regression or classification problems. The decision tree splits the training data into nodes, with the final node—referred to as the leaf node—which depicts the output class using Gini Index or Entropy. The KNN algorithm will classify the target variable based on the majority of classes that are among the K number of nearest neighbors. Both algorithms performed well and achieved high accuracy, but the decision tree performed slightly better than the KNN algorithm. This study aims to emphasize the use of such models in medical diagnostics and other potential fields.
